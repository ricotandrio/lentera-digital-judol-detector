# Lentera Digital Judol Detector

This is the Lentera Digital Judol Detector project, which consists of a server and a client component. The server provides an API for detecting judol on web pages, while the client is a Chrome extension that interacts with the server to perform the detection, and `model_training` is a script to train the model.
